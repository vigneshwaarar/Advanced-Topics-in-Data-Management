<h2>Introduction</h2>
  <center><p class = "ex"><big>This study attempts to collect students' tastes on final projects in ITM classes. In future, we can directly build intelligent systems to recommend topics or data to the students, in order to let them quickly find any projects they are interested in.</big></p></center>
<h2>Procedures</h2>
  <center><p class = "ex"><big>You will be be shown a list of movies, and you will be asked to rate movies by imagining in which situations you will go to see the movie. We also ask which situations you think are the best ones to see such a movie, and so on. This questionnaire will be conducted with an online Qualtrics-created survey.</big></p></center>
<h2>Benefits or Compensation</h2>
  <center><p class = "ex"><big>There are no direct benefits or compensation for participants. However, it is hoped that through your participation, researchers will learn more about your opinions on movie preferences so that we can provide better services in the future.</big></p></center>
<h2>Confidentiality</h2>
  <center><p class = "ex"><big>All data obtained from participants will be kept confidential and will only be reported in an aggregate format and the information about your identities will be anonymized. All questionnaires will be concealed, and no one other than then primary investigator and assistant researches will have access to them. The data collected will be stored in the HIPPA-compliant, Qualtrics-secure database until it has been deleted by the primary investigator.</big></p></center>
 <h2>Participation and Estimated Time</h2>
